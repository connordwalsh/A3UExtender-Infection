# Review record

## 12 November 2026 — Sprint 0 foundation and test tooling

Scope: product decisions/backlog, pinned dependency inventory and source
comparison, isolated launch/build scripts, prepared-class smoke fixture and
evidence collector, and the proposed Occupant impact matrix. This review does
not accept the Infection gameplay addon or close Sprint 0.

Developer self-review, as authorized by the product owner:

* Inspected the authored tools and documentation. The inherited gameplay examples
  remain outside the test launch stack. Mod archives, profiles, raw logs and
  third-party extracted source are excluded from Git.
* CfgConvert and FileBank produced the working standalone fixture. The original
  incomplete Eden structure was replaced after a reproducible launch loop.
* All 14 prepared classes completed the dedicated spawn/init/equipment/deletion
  checks. Model/skeleton/attachment errors on the large creatures remain open;
  the report correctly requires review despite its passing smoke assertions.
* The collector rejected a real non-starting log as incomplete. It requires
  unique complete records and the full candidate set, and does not publish raw
  player identifiers or absolute local paths.
* Python compilation, PowerShell syntax parsing and Git whitespace checks passed.
  Launchers isolate profiles and protect the owned probe install with a hash
  receipt. Repeated starts are rejected instead of sharing the same profile.
* The matrix names source owners, proposed changes and acceptance scenarios;
  source paths/hashes are verified against the pinned checkout. Remaining caller
  audit, the signed S3 route disposition and complete S4 mission catalog are open.

Integration decision: the foundation/tooling can merge independently. Keep S0-1,
S0-2 and S0-3 open for the documented remaining evidence. No user acceptance,
clean gameplay certification or Workshop release is implied.
